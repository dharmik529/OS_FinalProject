      <h2>Never Forget Again</h2>
      <p>As we get older, it can become harder to remember all the things we need to do. Missed medical appointments, forgetting to take medications, or neglecting important financial deadlines can have serious consequences.</p>

        <li>Mark reminders as completed or reschedule if needed</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Customize reminders to suit your needs. Set daily, weekly or one-time alerts. We handle the details so you can focus on living life to the fullest!</p>
