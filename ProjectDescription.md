# Final Project
## Final Project for CMPSC 472, Fall Semester, 2023

**Project Description:**

In this group project assignment, you and your team will embark on a creative and meaningful journey to develop a Software Application for Enhancing Happiness. The concept of "Software for Elderly" can take various forms, and your task is to ideate and create a project that contributes to the well-being and happiness of individuals. In this group project assignment, you and your team will embark on a creative and meaningful journey to develop a Software Application that reflects the knowledge and skills you have acquired in this course. This project serves as a culmination of your learning experience, aiming to apply what you've learned to solve real-world problems through software development and teamwork. The goal of your project is to create software that leverages the concepts, techniques, and best practices covered in the course, showcasing your ability to turn your theoretical understanding into practical solutions. By focusing on applying your course knowledge, you will gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter and how it translates into real-world applications.

**Project Groups:**

To facilitate collaboration and ensure that every student has the opportunity to work with a partner, group formation will follow the following guidelines:
1. Two-Person Groups: Students are encouraged to form their own groups consisting of two individuals who share a common interest or preference in the project topic. These groups should be formed voluntarily. 
2. Remaining Students: If there is an odd number of students or if an individual is unable to find a partner, they will be assigned to a group by the faculty. The faculty will make reasonable efforts to create groups that align with students' interests and skills.
3. Faculty-Assigned Groups: In cases that students are unable to find a partner or request faculty assistance, the faculty can assign groups to ensure that every student is part of a team.

**Expected Skills Gained:**

- Critical and creative thinking: Develop innovative solutions to enhance happiness.
- Developing a user-friendly interface: Create an application that is accessible and enjoyable to use.
- Collaborative coding: Learn to work effectively in a team, co-developing software.
- Real-world application: Apply your skills to a practical project with real use cases that contribute to well-being.

**Deliverables:**

1. Source Code: Submit the source code, including comments that explain the design and implementation. Store the code on a GitHub repository.
2. Project Report: Prepare a comprehensive project report that includes the following:
    - Project goals: Clearly define the project's objectives.
    - Significance of the project: Explain why the project is meaningful and how it contributes to happiness.
    - Installation and usage instructions: Provide clear instructions for installing and using the software.
    - Code structure: Present a systematic diagram of the code's structure and explanations for easy understanding.
    - List of functionalities and test results: Describe the functionalities and present testing results for verification.
    - Discussion and Conclusions: Address project issues, limitations, and how your course learnings were applied.
3. GitHub Repository Link: Share a GitHub repository link with the project report as a README (Markdown file) and the source code as a separate file.

**Grading Criteria:**
Your project will be assessed according to the following criteria:
1. Code (25%):
   - Code Quality: Code should be well-structured and readable.
   - User Interface: Ensure the user interface is user-friendly.

2. Report (50%):
   - Goal of the project (5%): Clearly state the project's objectives.
   - Significance of the project (10%): Explain the project's meaningfulness in enhancing happiness.
   - Installation and Instruction to use (5%): Provide clear installation and usage instructions.
   - Structure of the code (10%): Include a systematic code structure diagram and clear explanations.
   - Functionalities and Test Results (10%): Present functionalities and testing results for verification.
   - Discussion and Conclusions (10%): Discuss project issues, limitations, and the application of course learnings.

3. GitHub (25%):
   - Ensure all project components are on the GitHub repository.
   - Set the GitHub repository as public initially.

**Note**

Ensure that within your group, every member respects each other's contributions, including your own. If your team demonstrates harmonious dynamics and all members, including yourself, contributed equally, the same score will be assigned to all members of the group. In the event that you or another team member argues that your own or another member's contribution is weak, the faculty will listen to the perspectives of all group members, including yours, and decide the scores accordingly. This ensures fair assessment of individual contributions within the team.

Your project submission should include a GitHub repository link containing all the required deliverables for evaluation.

Everything here can be subject to change with common-sense reasoning.
